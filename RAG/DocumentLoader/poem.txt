“Lines of Code and Light”

A dream begins in silence, soft and small,
A thought that sparks within the weary night.
No sun, yet stars above the terminal call,
To birth new worlds from logic and from light.

Within each line, a whisper dares to rise,
Of hope, of fear, of systems yet unknown.
The keys resound like rain across the skies —
Creation hums beneath the silicon throne.

Errors may come, as shadows test your fight,
But dawn awaits those who persist in sight.
From tangled code, the harmony will sing,
And every loop completes another spring.
For craft outlives the fleeting hands of time,
Each function breathes, a poet’s living rhyme,
Till all the fragments form something divine.
